      "Magi is a beautiful, kindhearted woman whose striking looks are only a small part of her story. She grew up in small village in Ethiopia, and while she says moving to the U.S. was the scariest thing she has ever done, she doesn't regret it one bit. Magi was only able to move here after she literally won the Diversity Visa Lotto. She is so grateful for all the opportunities she's been given in life and knows firsthand to never take anything for granted. Working as both a model and a pharmacist, Magi keeps it a priority to show young women back in Ethiopia you can do both, and that you can achieve anything you set your mind to! People often describe her as being too nice, but she sees her kindness as her biggest strength and knows there is power and resilience behind it. She is loyal, honest and has a very positive outlook on the world. Magi is looking for a partner in life -- someone she can share everything with and who has a love and compassion for culture like she does. When she's not working or studying to further her career, she loves to explore her town's historical buildings, drink wine at her favorite local restaurants and spend nights in with her girlfriends watching movies. Meeting Matt will be a very new and exciting experience for Magi -- she grew up in a place where arranged marriages were very common, so she is excited to be here to show the women back home that everyone deserves to choose who they love",

    bio:
      "Sydney is a strong, opinionated woman who knows what she wants and isn't afraid to vocalize it. If her family could use one word to describe Sydney, it would be \"opinionated\"… and Sydney wholeheartedly agrees saying her role in life is to give facts over being a shoulder to cry on. Sydney may come off as tough, but just because she's blunt doesn't mean she isn't also a romantic at heart. Though Sydney says she is not your typical southern belle, she says she is a traditional romantic and hopes to find a man who will put effort into wooing her. She has always believed that opposites attract and dreams of finding a man with a mellow demeanor to balance out her outgoing personality. She hates awkward dinner conversation and says a man with big goals for the future is her biggest turn-on. Sydney wants someone who will bring what she does to a relationship -- love, loyalty, motivation and support -- and says that she's not looking to settle for any average Joe Schmoe. Nothing bothers Sydney more than people who beat around the bush, so let's hope Matt is ready to get straight to the point with Sydney!",

    bio:
      "Victoria, or Queen Victoria as she likes to refer to herself, has outgrown her \"once upon a time\" jetsetter lifestyle but not her sense of grandeur. Victoria has shifted focus towards entrepreneurship and has launched a few businesses in the health and beauty space. Victoria knows she has a big personality and needs a strong man who can keep up but who won't be controlling in any way, shape or form. The top things Victoria's needs in a relationship are loyalty, honesty and independence. Meditation and spirituality play a huge role in Victoria's life and to find someone who also is would be a huge plus for her. Victoria loves romance, and with her love language being physical touch, she hopes to find someone who appreciates that side of her. Victoria truly has no filter, which she loves about herself, and plans to be very forward in her pursuit of Matt. This girl knows what she wants, and good luck to anyone who tries to stop her!",
